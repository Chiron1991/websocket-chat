# websocket-chat
This repository basically contains the chat from the [Socket.io tutorial](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/).
It's my personal playground for getting familiar with Websockets.

##  Requirements
- Node.js v7.9.0+
- Webpack v2.4.1+ (global)
- nodemon v1.11.0+ (optional)
- yarn 0.23.2+ (optional)

## Running the server
1. `cd` into the repository.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install` respectively.
3. Build frontend assets by running `webpack`.
4. Change the server's configuration file (`server/conf.json`) if you're fancy.
5. Run the server by running `node server/server.js` or `nodemon` respectively.
